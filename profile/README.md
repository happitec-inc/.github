# WELCOME ABOARD, NEW EMPLOYEE!

We're happy to have you join the Happitec family! As our president and founder
Leo J. Zereb has often said, "Each employee is an important pixel in the overall
picture of Happitec."

We want your transition to Happitec to be as easy and pleasant as possible.
That's why we've prepared this benefits handbook and the accompanying packet
of computer-generated maps specially matched to your specific job location and
projected assignments.

## YOUR SPECIAL BENEFITS AS A HAPPITEC EMPLOYEE

As you know, the Hapeitec motto is "We'll bring a smile to your computer." We
also aim to bring a smile to our customers. That's why we want the employees
who interact with those customers to feel as good as can be about themselves. As
Leo J. Zereb likes to say, "When you feel happy, then you make others happy
just by being happy!"

We've planned our benefits package to include all the things you need to have to
feel good about yourself. Make sure you take advantage of your Happitec
benefits, so you'll have the kind of smiling face we like to see around Happitec.
When an employee is unhappy, we know that we've done our best and that
Happitec just isn't the right place for that person to be.

## Medical Benefits

We want you to look and feel your best. To make sure you do, our
comprehensive medical benefits include full coverage for doctor's visits,
hospitalization, and lab work, as well as specialty and cosmetic surgical
procedures such as hair transplants and weaves, sex-change operations, and
tummy tucks. We'll also pay up to $1 OOO for a new wardrobe for your newly-
designed figure. Beauty salon coverage is limited to one styling and manicure per
month.

## Exercise Benefits

To keep you looking fit and trim following your cosmetic surgery, every
Happitec branch office includes a fully-equipped exercise room which you may
use at your leisure. Just tell your supervisor that you're "keepin' fit for Happitec!"
Branch offices compete yearly at the Happitec Olympics, held at our interna-
tional headquarters in Paris.

## Dental Benefits

We want your smile to be as bright and welcoming as the smile on our Happitec
logo! That's why we give you full coverage for all your dental needs, including
gold fillings.jewel implants, and orthodontia. We'll even pay for your
toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash (up to 6 of each per year). So
why not go ahead and have that diamond imbedded in your incisor? It will
sparkle a welcome each time you smile.

## Life Insurance

To protect your loved ones, we pay the cost of coverage for you at 26 times your
weekly base salary!

## Accidental Death & Dismemberment

Accidents happen. And we make sure you're covered. Ask your Branch
Personnel Officer for Hai;>pitec Personnel Pamphlet #673, "You've Already
Suffered Enough: A Sensitive Guide to Compensation for Loss of Life or Limb."
Coverage includes accidents occurring while you are traveling to, from, or for
Happitec, in any vehicle from a hang glider to a rickshaw.

## Stock Options 

Happitec's Employee Stock Option Plan gives you the opportunity to buy shares
of Happitec Common Stock through payroll deduction at 10% off the current
market rate. Like common stock issued by all companies, ours can decrease in
value as well as increase and there are no guarantees connected with this plan.
However, we are happy to say that Happitec Common Stock has increased in
value by at least 3% during each of the past three years. We consider it a very
good value. Don't you?

## Vacation Benefits

For each week you work at Happitec, you will accrue 1.48 hours of vacation
time. In addition, as our way of saying "Thanks for your loyalty!", a bonus of
5.93 hours is added to your vacation fund at the end of each year. And that's
only your personal vacation time!

Happitec also schedules numerous retreats throughout the year, where employees
get together for rest and relaxation. Often these retreats are combined with
beneficial training seminars which help you reach your full potential as a
Happitec employee. Happitec retreats are held anywhere from Miami to
Mustique, so have your clipboard and suntan lotion at the ready!

## Holidays
As a Happitec employee, you'll receive 15 holidays per year, including Bastille
Day, the Ochremango Festival, and the Annual Celebration of St. Stephanitis. Enjoy, enjoy!
